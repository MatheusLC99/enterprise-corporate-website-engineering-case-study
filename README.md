⚠️ Proprietary Work Notice

This repository documents the engineering architecture, technical decisions

## Executive Summary

I led the full technical rebuild of a legacy corporate website into a
modern full-stack TypeScript platform designed to improve:

- Conversion rate
- UX clarity
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Engineering scalability

Instead of treating the website as a static marketing page,
the architecture was designed as a modular product foundation,
capable of evolving into a scalable platform.
